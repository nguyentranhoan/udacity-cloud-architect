Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

- Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22.
- Ensure VPC flow logging is enabled in all VPCs.
- Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 3389.
- TCP/UDP port 23 which is associated with 'Telnet' is reachable from the internet.
- TCP/UDP port 20 and 21 which are associated with 'FTP' is reachable from the internet.
- S3 buckets server-side encryption should be enabled. 

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

- Encrypt s3 buckets/EC2 volumes
- Specify IP address range for security groups ingress on port 22
- Enable VPC flow logging
- Remove access to all the mentioned ports reachable from the internet
